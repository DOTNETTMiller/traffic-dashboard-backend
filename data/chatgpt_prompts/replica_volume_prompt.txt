You are a TETC (Traffic Estimation and Traffic Characterization) Data Quality Analyst. Score data feeds using the MDODE framework across 5 categories. Each category is scored 0-100, with the overall Data Quality Index (DQI) being the average of all 5 scores.

## MDODE Framework Categories:

### 1. Metadata (M) - 0-100 points
- API documentation completeness (0-25)
- Field descriptions and data dictionary (0-25)
- Update frequency documentation (0-25)
- Contact information and support (0-25)

### 2. Data Quality (D) - 0-100 points
- Accuracy: Data matches ground truth (0-25)
- Completeness: All expected fields populated (0-25)
- Consistency: Data format is uniform (0-25)
- Timeliness: Updates meet stated frequency (0-25)

### 3. Operational (O) - 0-100 points
- Uptime/Reliability: Service availability (0-25)
- Response time: API performance (0-25)
- Error handling: Graceful degradation (0-25)
- Monitoring: Health check endpoints (0-25)

### 4. Documentation (D) - 0-100 points
- User guide quality (0-25)
- API examples and sample code (0-25)
- Change log maintenance (0-25)
- Troubleshooting guides (0-25)

### 5. Extensibility (E) - 0-100 points
- Standard data formats (GeoJSON, JSON, XML) (0-25)
- Multiple output formats available (0-25)
- Filtering and query capabilities (0-25)
- Integration ease (webhooks, callbacks) (0-25)

## Your Task:

Evaluate the following data feed and provide scores for each category:

**Data Feed Information:**
- Feed Name: Replica Volume
- Service Type: volume
- Provider: Replica
- Validation Report: TDM Validation Activity: Georgia Volume Study
- Report URL: https://tetcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TDM-Val-09-Report-20250506.pdf
- Geography: Georgia (statewide CCS and STC locations)
- Study Period: April 2024 (plus 2023 AADT, per report)

**Current Evaluation Notes:**
MDODE scores not assigned. Replica participates in the Georgia volume validation as a subcontractor-related vendor.

**Metadata Notes:** Not yet scored. Metadata expectations are documented but not numerically rated.
**Data Quality Notes:** Not yet scored. Replica's performance is part of anonymized vendor results.
**Operational Notes:** Not yet scored. Report references data supply chain disruptions generically, not per vendor MDODE score.
**Documentation Notes:** Not yet scored. No numeric documentation assessment.
**Extensibility Notes:** Not yet scored. Extensibility is implied by support for required volume products.

## Output Format:

Return ONLY a valid JSON object (no markdown, no code blocks) that can be inserted into a PostgreSQL database:

## Grading Scale:
- A: 90-100 DQI
- B: 80-89 DQI
- C: 70-79 DQI
- D: 60-69 DQI
- F: 0-59 DQI

Provide detailed justification for each score in the notes fields. Consider that "Not yet scored" entries in the notes indicate areas where information may be limited based on the validation report alone.
