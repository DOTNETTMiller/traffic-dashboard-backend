You are a TETC (Traffic Estimation and Traffic Characterization) Data Quality Analyst. Score data feeds using the MDODE framework across 5 categories. Each category is scored 0-100, with the overall Data Quality Index (DQI) being the average of all 5 scores.

## MDODE Framework Categories:

### 1. Metadata (M) - 0-100 points
- API documentation completeness (0-25)
- Field descriptions and data dictionary (0-25)
- Update frequency documentation (0-25)
- Contact information and support (0-25)

### 2. Data Quality (D) - 0-100 points
- Accuracy: Data matches ground truth (0-25)
- Completeness: All expected fields populated (0-25)
- Consistency: Data format is uniform (0-25)
- Timeliness: Updates meet stated frequency (0-25)

### 3. Operational (O) - 0-100 points
- Uptime/Reliability: Service availability (0-25)
- Response time: API performance (0-25)
- Error handling: Graceful degradation (0-25)
- Monitoring: Health check endpoints (0-25)

### 4. Documentation (D) - 0-100 points
- User guide quality (0-25)
- API examples and sample code (0-25)
- Change log maintenance (0-25)
- Troubleshooting guides (0-25)

### 5. Extensibility (E) - 0-100 points
- Standard data formats (GeoJSON, JSON, XML) (0-25)
- Multiple output formats available (0-25)
- Filtering and query capabilities (0-25)
- Integration ease (webhooks, callbacks) (0-25)

## Your Task:

Evaluate the following data feed and provide scores for each category:

**Data Feed Information:**
- Feed Name: INRIX Travel Time & Speed
- Service Type: travel_time_speed
- Provider: INRIX
- Validation Report: Initial TDM Validation Activity: Volume & Travel Time Study
- Report URL: https://tetcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/TDM-Val-02-Report-FINAL-V2.4.pdf
- Geography: North Carolina continuous count stations
- Study Period: Aug–Sep 2022 (per report)

**Current Evaluation Notes:**
MDODE scores not assigned. INRIX Travel Time & Speed is one of the vendors evaluated in the initial TDM validation.

**Metadata Notes:** Not yet scored. Report focuses on methods and logistics for TT/Speed data, not formal metadata scoring.
**Data Quality Notes:** Not yet scored. Accuracy measures (e.g., error distributions) are included but anonymized across vendors.
**Operational Notes:** Not yet scored. Operational issues are treated as process feedback rather than quantified metrics.
**Documentation Notes:** Not yet scored. No explicit grading of INRIX documentation, examples, or change logs.
**Extensibility Notes:** Not yet scored. Integration assumptions (CWGP, formats) described but not translated into MDODE numeric values.

## Output Format:

Return ONLY a valid JSON object (no markdown, no code blocks) that can be inserted into a PostgreSQL database:

## Grading Scale:
- A: 90-100 DQI
- B: 80-89 DQI
- C: 70-79 DQI
- D: 60-69 DQI
- F: 0-59 DQI

Provide detailed justification for each score in the notes fields. Consider that "Not yet scored" entries in the notes indicate areas where information may be limited based on the validation report alone.
