**Finding:** Queue Warning Systems (QWS) reduce the potential for rear-end crashes **by 18 to 45 percent** on work zone approaches, depending on deployment context.

**Study Details:**
- Scope: Multiple state DOT deployments analyzed
- Technology: Various queue warning system configurations
- Primary benefit: Rear-end crash prevention in work zone queue situations
- Range explanation: Effectiveness varies based on traffic volume, queue frequency, and warning system configuration

---

### Citation 4: Michigan & Wisconsin DOT Studies (15-65% Crash Reduction Range)

**Source:** Michigan DOT and Wisconsin DOT Queue Warning System Evaluations

**Findings:**
- **Michigan DOT:** 40% to 60% reduction in total rear-end crashes
- **Wisconsin DOT:** 15% reduction in queue-related crashes and 65% reduction in injury crashes

**Context:** Different effectiveness for total crashes vs. injury crashes demonstrates that queue warning systems particularly reduce crash severity.

## Variable Speed Limits for Weather Conditions

### Citation 5: Washington State I-5 VSL System (29% Total Crash Reduction)

**Source:** FHWA Report FHWA-HRT-21-053 - "Developing Crash Modification Factors for Variable Speed Limits"

**Finding:** Variable Speed Limit (VSL) system implementation on I-5 in Washington was associated with a **29% crash reduction (±5% standard error)** using observational empirical Bayes before-after analysis.

**Additional Finding:** Statistically significant crash reductions at 95% confidence level:
- **29.2% reduction in total crashes**
- **35.2% reduction in rear-end crashes**

**Study Details:**
- Location: Interstate 5 (I-5), Washington State
- Methodology: Empirical Bayes before-after analysis with comparison groups
- Technology: Weather-responsive Variable Speed Limit system
- Mechanism: VSLs use prevailing roadway information (traffic speed, volumes, weather, road surface conditions) to determine appropriate speeds and reduce speed variance

**Crash Prevention Mechanism:**
- Improves speed harmonization (reduces speed variance between vehicles)
- Provides advance information to drivers about slowdowns and potential hazards
- Reduces probability of secondary crashes through better driver expectation
- Particularly effective during wet weather conditions (12.6% of fatal crashes occur on wet pavement nationally)

## Connected Vehicle (V2X) Crash Reduction

### Citation 6: NHTSA V2X Crash Reduction Estimate (Up to 80% of Non-Impaired Crashes)

**Source:** NHTSA Study cited in NTSB Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communications Summit, August 25, 2022

**Finding:** NHTSA estimates that V2X technology could **address up to 80% of all crashes involving non-impaired drivers.**

**Important Context:**
- This 80% figure applies broadly to **all crash types** involving non-impaired drivers
- It represents the **potential addressable crashes**, not guaranteed reduction
- Includes vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) applications
- The NTSB has issued safety studies on motorcycle safety (2018) and bicyclist safety (2019), with six recommendations to incorporate vulnerable road users into connected vehicle technology

**Note:** This estimate does NOT provide a specific percentage reduction for pedestrian/cyclist fatalities alone. The 80% represents the overall crash population that V2X systems could theoretically address through warnings and interventions.

**URL:** https://www.ntsb.gov/Advocacy/Activities/Pages/Graham20220825.aspx

---

### Citation 7: Connected Vehicle Pilot Program - Driver Response Rates

**Source:** USDOT Connected Vehicle Pilot Deployment Program, 2024 Update

**Findings:**
- **Wyoming DOT (Jan 2021-April 2022):** 56% of drivers responded appropriately to work zone alerts
- **General Forward Collision Warnings:** 85% driver response rate to V2X-based Forward Collision Warnings
- **Utah DOT V2X Snowplow Study:** 22% decrease in property damage crashes on routes equipped with V2X snowplow alerts compared to non-equipped routes (3.9 vs 1.8 crash rate)

**Study Details:**
- Multi-state pilot program testing real-world V2X deployments
- Demonstrates both driver acceptance and measurable safety benefits
- Includes work zone safety, collision avoidance, and weather-related applications

**Context for Policy:** While these pilot results show promise, they represent specific deployment contexts. The claimed "20-30% reduction in pedestrian/cyclist fatalities" in the TDI response extrapolates beyond available data and should be qualified or cited differently.

## Economic Benefits - ITS Operational Savings

### Citation 8: National Congestion Costs ($200B Annually)

**Source:** US Department of Transportation Economic Analysis

**Finding:** Congestion costs America an estimated **$200 billion per year** in lost travel time and fuel.

**Context:** This represents the total national cost of congestion, not the savings attributable to ITS. ITS deployments address a portion of this through:
- Incident management (reduced clearance times)
- Traffic signal optimization
- Traveler information systems
- Work zone management
- Freight efficiency improvements

---

### Citation 9: ITS Benefits Database

**Source:** USDOT ITS Joint Program Office (JPO) - ITS Benefits, Costs, and Lessons Learned Reports (2003, 2005, 2017, 2018 editions)

**Purpose:** The ITS JPO maintains an ITS Benefits Database documenting findings from evaluation of ITS deployments across nearly twenty years of data, providing transportation professionals with synthesis of:
- Safety benefits
- Operational efficiency gains
- Mobility improvements
- Environmental impacts
- Freight efficiency

**Note:** The database provides case-study evidence of ITS effectiveness but does not aggregate to a single "$2-5B annually" national figure. The TDI response claim of "$2-5B annually from improved operations, safety, freight efficiency" appears to be an estimate rather than a cited figure from this database.

**URL:** https://www.itskrs.its.dot.gov/

**Recommendation:** The "$2-5B annually" economic benefit claim should either:
1. Be qualified as an "estimated" figure based on extrapolation from pilot studies, OR
2. Be replaced with specific case study examples from the ITS Benefits Database, OR
3. Be removed if a credible source cannot be identified
