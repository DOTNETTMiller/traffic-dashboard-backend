# TDI Policy Response Restructuring Notes

## Issue Identified
The current `TDI_POLICY_RESPONSE.md` document does not match the official U.S. DOT RFI question structure.

## Current Structure (INCORRECT)
- **Section A:** Research, Development and Deployment
- **Section B:** Data Accessibility and Availability
- **Section C:** Workforce Development
- **Section D:** Digital Standards Lifecycle Framework

## Required Structure (CORRECT)
See `TDI_RFI_QUESTIONS_REFERENCE.md` for the complete official structure:

- **Section A:** Research, Development and Deployment (6 questions)
- **Section B:** System Architecture, Interoperability and Standards (6 questions)
- **Section C:** Artificial Intelligence and Automation (4 questions)
- **Section D:** Data Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity (6 questions)

## Action Required

The document needs to be manually restructured to answer the specific RFI questions. The existing content is comprehensive and valuable but needs to be reorganized under the correct question headings.

### Recommended Approach:

1. **Review existing content** in `TDI_POLICY_RESPONSE.md` (1451 lines)
2. **Map content to official questions** using `TDI_RFI_QUESTIONS_REFERENCE.md`
3. **Reorganize sections** to match the 4-part structure with proper question numbering
4. **Ensure all 22 questions are addressed:**
   - A: 6 questions
   - B: 6 questions
   - C: 4 questions
   - D: 6 questions

### Content Mapping Hints:

**Current Section B (Data Accessibility)** likely maps to:
- New Section B (System Architecture, Interoperability and Standards)
- New Section D (Data Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity)

**Current Section C (Workforce Development)** could map to:
- Section A.2 (What TDI research needs should be prioritized?)
- Or be incorporated into other sections as supporting content

**Current Section D (Digital Standards Lifecycle)** likely maps to:
- New Section B (System Architecture, Interoperability and Standards)

## Files Created:
- `TDI_RFI_QUESTIONS_REFERENCE.md` - Official RFI question structure
- `TDI_RESTRUCTURING_NOTES.md` - This file

## Status:
**Awaiting manual restructuring** - The existing content is too extensive and nuanced for automated reorganization. Human review needed to ensure policy responses properly address each official RFI question.
