## A. Research, Development and Deployment

### 1. How should Transportation Digital Infrastructure be defined?

### 2. What TDI research needs should be prioritized?

### 3. What travel corridors or regions should be prioritized for TDI development and deployment?

### 4. Are there existing testbeds, pilots or demonstrations that could be leveraged?

### 5. What TDI use cases or applications should be prioritized?

### 6. How should U.S. DOT leverage or expand existing programs to advance TDI development and deployment?

---

## B. System Architecture, Interoperability and Standards

### 1. What are the key elements of a TDI system architecture that can accommodate the operation of all transportation modes including surface, maritime, and aviation?

### 2. How can TDI be integrated into infrastructure planning, construction and asset management processes?

### 3. What methods should be used for federating data sharing across States and regions?

### 4. What existing architecture frameworks or standards could be used to underpin TDI development and deployment (e.g., U.S. DOT's Architecture Reference for Cooperative and Intelligent Transportation (ARC-IT))?

### 5. What are the necessary latency and throughput requirements for safety-critical applications (e.g., Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, Automated Driving Systems (ADS), and Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA))?

### 6. What are the highest-priority research gaps and challenges to advancing interoperability across modes and sectors?

---

## C. Artificial Intelligence and Automation

### 1. How should AI applications be leveraged to support TDI development and deployment?

### 2. How should TDI be best used to accelerate the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles, drones and other transformative technologies?

### 3. What are the highest-value, near-time AI and automation applications enabled by comprehensive sensing and data sharing?

### 4. How can AI applications be safely deployed to accommodate data exchange and data use across jurisdictional boundaries?

---

## D. Data Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity

### 1. What data governance principles, access controls, and cybersecurity measures are needed to ensure trust, accountability, and privacy?

### 2. What models or frameworks should be used to ensure secure data exchange (e.g., data trusts, federated data sharing, and public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs))?

### 3. What are the most significant threat vectors introduced by extensive transportation system sensing and data integration, beyond traditional Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) threats?

### 4. How should U.S. DOT apply the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to TDI development and deployment?

### 5. How should TDI be aligned with federal data strategies and privacy frameworks?

### 6. How can legacy and proprietary data sources be effectively incorporated into a new national data exchange environment?
