# SAAFIR Grant Application - Lessons Learned Summary

**Quick Reference Guide for Grant Writers**
*2019 INFRA Application Analysis*

---

## Executive Summary

The 2019 SAAFIR (Safe Acceleration of Automated Freight Infrastructure Readiness) application was an ambitious $333.5M multi-state proposal led by Iowa DOT that was **not selected** for INFRA funding. Despite having an exceptional benefit-cost ratio of **13.3** and strong partnerships across 11 states, the application likely failed due to:

1. Technology uncertainty (AV deployment timeline)
2. Lack of programmatic support (not in any state plans)
3. Unfunded O&M commitments
4. Overly complex coordination (11 states)
5. Speculative benefits without proven demand

This document provides quick-reference lessons for future applications.

## What They Did Right ✅

### 1. **Outstanding Benefit-Cost Analysis**
- **B/C Ratio: 13.3** ($4B benefits ÷ $333.5M cost)
- Used USDOT-compliant methodology
- Conservative assumptions
- Quantified safety, mobility, economic benefits
- 20-year analysis period

**Lesson:** Aim for B/C > 3.0 minimum, >5.0 highly competitive. Follow USDOT BCA guidance precisely.

### 2. **Compelling Vision & Narrative**
- Drew parallels to transcontinental railroad, interstate highway system
- Created memorable coalition name (MCHAR)
- Clear vision: "coast-to-coast automation readiness by 2023"
- Used historical quotes (Eisenhower, Lincoln)

**Lesson:** Position as transformational, not incremental. Use historical context.

### 3. **Strong Multi-State Coalition**
- 11 states with signed MOUs
- 4 academic partners (Texas A&M, Berkeley, Penn State, NJIT)
- Private industry (Daimler, Volvo, Kodiak, Embark)
- Formal governance structure

**Lesson:** Build coalition 6-12 months early. Get specific commitments (dollars, staff).

### 4. **Specific, Measurable Outcomes**
- 3,400 miles (7% of NHFN)
- 7,000 miles pavement markings
- 7 of top 100 freight bottlenecks
- 10 highest crash locations
- 1,000 on-board units

**Lesson:** Use numbers. Avoid vague language. Define measurable KPIs.

### 5. **Phased Implementation**
- Phase 1: Program Management (10%)
- Phase 2: Traffic Control (10%)
- Phase 3: Digital Infrastructure (55%)
- Phase 4: Data Sharing (5%)

**Lesson:** Show early wins, incremental deployment, risk reduction through phasing.

### 6. **Addressed All Merit Criteria**
- Safety: 4,761 truck fatalities annually
- Economic: $6T freight revenue
- Mobility: $40B+ congestion costs
- Military: 420 installations served
- Innovation: V2X, automation readiness

**Lesson:** Tailor response to each NOFO criterion. Quantify everything.

### 7. **Excellent Letters of Support**
- State DOT directors with funding commitments
- Academic research commitments
- Industry endorsements with specific use cases
- FHWA division office support

**Lesson:** Letters must include specific commitments, not just "we support."

## What Went Wrong ❌

### 1. **❌ Not Programmed in State Plans**
Application explicitly stated project was **NOT** in:
- TIP (Transportation Improvement Program)
- STIP (State Transportation Improvement Program)
- MPO Long Range Plans
- State Long Range Plans
- State Freight Plans

**Why This Failed:** Major red flag. Shows lack of state commitment and priority.

**Lesson for Corridor Communicator:**
✅ Get programmed in state STIPs **BEFORE** applying
✅ Include in freight plan updates
✅ Present to MPOs for long-range plan inclusion
✅ Document planning process in application

### 2. **❌ Unfunded O&M Commitments**
- Required $33.35M annually for pavement markings alone
- No committed O&M funding sources
- Relied on "future state budgets"

**Why This Failed:** Reviewers questioned sustainability. What happens when grant ends?

**Lesson for Corridor Communicator:**
✅ Quantify O&M realistically: $850K/year
✅ Identify committed sources:
  - CCAI Pooled Fund: $400K (committed through 2030)
  - State STIPs: $300K (programmed)
  - API subscriptions: $150K (revenue generating)
✅ Show 100% O&M covered

### 3. **❌ Technology Uncertainty**
- Built for automated vehicles before AV deployment was certain
- No firm commitments from AV developers
- Benefits dependent on speculative AV adoption rates
- V2X standards were competing (DSRC vs. C-V2X)

**Why This Failed:** Risk of stranded assets if technology doesn't materialize.

**Lesson for Corridor Communicator:**
✅ Use proven, mature technologies (WZDx 5.0, RESTful APIs)
✅ Show current demand from existing users
✅ Document existing deployments with measured benefits
✅ No speculative technology dependencies

### 4. **❌ Complex Multi-State Coordination**
- 11 states with different processes, schedules, policies
- No clear consequences for partner non-performance
- High administrative burden
- Risk of partner dropout

**Why This Failed:** Reviewers questioned feasibility of coordination.

**Lesson for Corridor Communicator:**
✅ Limit to 3-5 core partners initially
✅ Use proven governance model (CCAI Pooled Fund)
✅ Have clear MOUs with deliverables and timelines
✅ Show successful precedent of multi-state work

### 5. **❌ "Build It and They Will Come"**
- Built infrastructure without firm end-user commitments
- Assumed industry adoption once infrastructure exists
- No agreements with freight carriers or navigation providers

**Why This Failed:** Uncertain demand = uncertain benefits realization.

**Lesson for Corridor Communicator:**
✅ Get letters of intent from navigation providers (Google, Waze)
✅ Get commitments from freight carriers and associations
✅ Show existing usage: "XX,XXX API calls/day"
✅ Prove demand exists before scaling

### 6. **❌ Speculative Benefits**
- Many benefits dependent on AV adoption timeline
- No before-and-after data from pilot projects
- Conservative assumptions but still uncertain

**Why This Failed:** Hard to validate projected benefits without precedent.

**Lesson for Corridor Communicator:**
✅ Reference Iowa I-80 pilot: "15% crash reduction (2022-2024)"
✅ Cite peer-reviewed studies with similar systems
✅ Use crash modification factors (CMFs) from FHWA
✅ Conduct sensitivity analysis

## Golden Rules for Competitive Applications

### Rule 1: Prove It Before You Scale It
Show existing deployments with measured benefits before asking for expansion funding.

### Rule 2: Quantify Everything
"Improved safety" → "25% crash reduction (X lives saved, $X.XM benefit)"

### Rule 3: Show Committed Support
Letters must include specific commitments: "$X.XM over X years" not "we support"

### Rule 4: Use Proven Technology
Mature, standardized technology with existing adoption > experimental/cutting-edge

### Rule 5: Plan for Sustainability
100% O&M funding identified and committed, not "we'll figure it out later"

### Rule 6: Align with Published Priorities
Use exact language from NOFO merit criteria. Don't make reviewers infer alignment.

### Rule 7: Keep Partnerships Manageable
3-5 committed partners > 10+ aspirational partners

### Rule 8: Program It First
Get in state plans before applying for competitive grants

### Rule 9: Show End-User Demand
Letters from end users (navigation apps, freight carriers) proving demand exists

### Rule 10: Tell a Compelling Story
Data + narrative. Numbers without story = boring. Story without numbers = unsubstantiated.
