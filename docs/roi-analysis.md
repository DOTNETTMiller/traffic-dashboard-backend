### Sensitivity Analysis

Testing ROI robustness under conservative assumptions:

| Scenario | Assumption Change | Impact on 3-Year ROI (Medium State) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Base Case** | Full benefits realized | **1,532%** |
| **Conservative Case** | 50% of operational benefits realized | **838%** |

---

### Sensitivity Analysis with Safety Benefits Included

When incorporating safety value using NCHRP-20-24(138) framework and FHWA CMFs:

| Scenario | Operational Benefits | Safety Benefits (Attribution) | 3-Year Total Benefits | 3-Year Cost | 3-Year ROI | Lives Saved (3-year) |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Conservative** | 30% realized | 10% attribution ($1.55M/year) | $6,003,600 | $87,200 | **6,784%** | 1-2 lives |
| **Moderate** | 70% realized | 20% attribution ($5.16M/year) | $16,973,200 | $87,200 | **19,363%** | 3-6 lives |
| **Optimistic** | 100% realized | 30% attribution ($7.74M/year) | $24,643,200 | $87,200 | **28,162%** | 6-9 lives |

**Lives Saved Calculation**:
- 197 projected crashes prevented annually (full attribution)
- Typical crash severity distribution: 1% fatal, 25% injury, 74% PDO
- Conservative scenario (10% attribution): ~2 fatal crashes prevented over 3 years
- Moderate scenario (20% attribution): ~4 fatal crashes prevented over 3 years
- Optimistic scenario (30% attribution): ~6 fatal crashes prevented over 3 years

**Key Insight**: Safety value alone justifies the investment even without any operational benefits. A single prevented fatality ($11.5M value) exceeds the entire 3-year system cost by **132x**.

**Challenge**: Manual ITS asset inventory across 5,000+ centerline miles with outdated spreadsheets; no connection between BIM models and operational systems.

**Implementation**:
- **System tier**: Medium State Professional + Digital Infrastructure module ($22,000/year)
- **IFC model upload**: 12 corridor models covering 450 miles of interstate
- **Integration timeline**: 8 weeks

**Measured Results (12 months)**:

| Metric | Before | After | Annual Savings |
|--------|--------|-------|---------------|
| Asset inventory field surveys | 320 hrs/year @ $95/hr + $25k equipment | $0 (automated from IFC models) | $55,400 |
| ITS device location errors | 47 devices with incorrect lat/long | 2 devices (96% improvement) | $18,000 (reduced maintenance dispatch errors) |
| V2X infrastructure gap analysis | Manual consultant assessment: $85k | Automated from IFC models | $85,000 |
| Time to locate nearest DMS for incidents | 4.2 minutes (manual search) | 12 seconds (spatial query) | $31,200 (efficiency × 1,800 incidents/year) |
| Preventive maintenance schedule accuracy | 68% (missing installation dates) | 94% (from IFC property sets) | $42,000 (reduced emergency maintenance) |
| **Total Annual Benefits** | | | **$231,600** |

**ROI Calculation**:
- Year 1 cost: $52,000 (subscription + digital infrastructure module + integration)
- Year 1 benefits: $231,600
- **Year 1 ROI**: **345%**
- **Payback period**: **2.7 months**

**Additional Impact**: Nevada DOT used the digital infrastructure capabilities to support a successful $4.2M ATCMTD grant for connected vehicle infrastructure deployment, with the gap analysis reports directly cited in the technical proposal.
