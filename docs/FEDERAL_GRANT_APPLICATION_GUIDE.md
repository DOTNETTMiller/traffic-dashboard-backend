## Executive Summary

This guide distills lessons from the 2019 SAAFIR (Safe Acceleration of Automated Freight Infrastructure Readiness) INFRA grant application - a $333.5M multi-state proposal that was not selected for funding. By analyzing both its strengths and weaknesses, we provide actionable guidance for Corridor Communicator grant applications.

**Key Takeaway:** The SAAFIR application excelled in vision, coalition-building, and benefit-cost analysis (B/C ratio of 13.3) but likely failed due to technology uncertainty, lack of programmatic support, complex multi-state coordination risks, and uncertain O&M funding.

## Strengths to Replicate

### 1. Compelling Vision with Historical Context

**SAAFIR Example:**
> *"Just like Abraham Lincoln in 1865... to begin building the infrastructure to support highway automation, and the time is now."*

Drew parallels to:
- Transcontinental railroad (Lincoln, 1865)
- Interstate Highway System (Eisenhower, 1955)
- Transcontinental telephone (Bell, 1915)

**How to Apply:**
- Position your project as transformational, not incremental
- Use historical context to show pattern of infrastructure investment
- Create a memorable vision statement
- Connect to current national priorities

**Corridor Communicator Template:**
```
Vision: Create the nation's first multi-state work zone data intelligence
network, continuing America's tradition of infrastructure innovation that
began with the Interstate Highway System. Just as Eisenhower connected
states with physical roadways, Corridor Communicator connects states with
digital infrastructure for real-time work zone safety.
```

### 2. Strong Coalition & Multi-Stakeholder Support

**SAAFIR Approach:**
- 11 state DOTs committed with matching funds
- 4 major academic institutions (Texas A&M, UC Berkeley, Penn State, NJIT)
- Private industry (Daimler, Volvo, Kodiak Robotics, Embark Trucking)
- Formal governance structure: Multi-State Cooperative on Highway Automation Readiness (MCHAR)

**How to Apply:**
- **Start Early:** Begin coalition-building 6-12 months before application
- **Get Commitments:** Letters of intent with specific dollar amounts
- **Diverse Partners:** Public agencies, academics, private sector, end users
- **Clear Structure:** Define roles, responsibilities, and governance

**Corridor Communicator Coalition Components:**
```
✅ State DOTs: Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nebraska (CCAI Pooled Fund members)
✅ Academic Partners: Iowa State University, University of Iowa NADS
✅ Industry Partners:
   - Work zone contractors (specific companies)
   - Technology vendors (WZDx implementers)
   - Trucking associations (ATA, state chapters)
✅ Federal Partners: FHWA, FMCSA
✅ End Users: Trucking companies, freight carriers, navigation providers
```

## Weaknesses to Avoid

### 1. ❌ Uncertain Technology Adoption

**SAAFIR Issue:**
- Built infrastructure for automated vehicles before AV deployment was certain
- Relied on industry adoption without firm commitments
- Technology timeline was speculative (automation by 2023/2024)

**Why It Failed:**
Reviewers likely questioned: *"What if AVs don't deploy as expected? Will this infrastructure sit unused?"*

**How to Avoid:**
✅ **Use proven, mature technologies** with current demand
✅ **Demonstrate existing users** who will immediately benefit
✅ **Show deployment commitments** from end users
✅ **Provide fallback utility** even if primary use case doesn't materialize

**Corridor Communicator Advantage:**
- ✅ Work zone data is **needed NOW** by trucking industry, navigation apps
- ✅ Technology is **mature** (WZDx 5.0, APIs, standard formats)
- ✅ **Existing users**: Waze, Google Maps, commercial fleets already consuming feeds
- ✅ **Proven ROI**: Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania have operating systems with measurable benefits

### 2. ❌ Projects Not Programmed in State Plans

**SAAFIR Issue:**
Application explicitly stated project was **NOT** in:
- ❌ TIP (Transportation Improvement Program)
- ❌ STIP (State Transportation Improvement Program)
- ❌ MPO Long Range Transportation Plan
- ❌ State Long Range Transportation Plan
- ❌ State Freight Plan

**Why It Failed:**
This is a **major red flag** indicating:
- Lack of state commitment
- Not a priority at state level
- May not align with established planning processes
- Uncertain sustainability

**How to Avoid:**
✅ **Get programmed FIRST** before applying for competitive grants
✅ **Include in freight plans** and long-range plans during update cycles
✅ **Work with MPOs** for metropolitan area projects
✅ **Document planning process** that led to project

**Action Items for Corridor Communicator:**
1. Work with state DOTs to include in next STIP update
2. Coordinate with freight advisory committees for freight plan inclusion
3. Present to MPOs for long-range plan consideration
4. Document in application: "Included in Iowa Statewide Freight Plan (2024), Ohio STIP (2025), Pennsylvania Long Range Plan (2024)"

### 3. ❌ Unfunded Operations & Maintenance (O&M)

**SAAFIR Issue:**
- Required $33.35M annually for pavement marking maintenance alone
- O&M funding was aspirational, not committed
- Relied on future state budget allocations

**Why It Failed:**
Reviewers likely questioned: *"What happens after federal grant ends? Will states actually fund O&M or will system deteriorate?"*

**How to Avoid:**
✅ **Quantify O&M costs** realistically in application
✅ **Identify committed funding sources** (state budgets, toll revenues, etc.)
✅ **Show historical precedent** of state funding similar systems
✅ **Include O&M plan** with responsibility matrix
✅ **Consider cost recovery** mechanisms (user fees, subscription models)

**Corridor Communicator O&M Strategy:**
```
Annual O&M Cost Estimate: $850,000
- Cloud hosting & data storage: $300,000
- Software maintenance & updates: $200,000
- Staff support (4 FTE across states): $250,000
- Field equipment maintenance: $100,000

Committed Funding Sources:
1. CCAI Pooled Fund continuation: $400,000/year (committed through 2030)
2. State STIP allocations: $300,000/year (programmed in IA, OH, PA STIPs)
3. API subscription revenue: $150,000/year (projected based on current usage)

Total: $850,000/year ✅ Fully funded

Sustainability Plan:
- Phase out grant funding over 3 years (100% → 50% → 0%)
- Increase pooled fund contributions incrementally
- Expand API subscription program to freight industry
- Potential future: FHWA recurring funding for national WZDx infrastructure
```

### 4. ❌ Overly Complex Multi-Jurisdictional Coordination

**SAAFIR Issue:**
- 11 states with different policies, procurement processes, schedules
- Risk of partner dropout or delays
- Coordination burden on lead agency
- No clear consequences if partners fail to deliver

**Why It Failed:**
Reviewers likely questioned: *"How will you coordinate 11 states? What if one state drops out? This seems administratively risky."*

**How to Avoid:**
✅ **Limit to 3-5 core partners** for initial deployment
✅ **Have clear MOUs** with specific deliverables and timelines
✅ **Define consequences** for non-performance
✅ **Show successful precedent** of multi-state coordination
✅ **Identify lead agency with experience** managing similar coalitions

**Corridor Communicator Approach:**
```
Core Partners (Tier 1): 4 states
- Iowa DOT (Lead Applicant)
- Ohio DOT
- Pennsylvania DOT
- Nebraska DOR

Each has:
✅ Existing Corridor Communicator deployment
✅ CCAI Pooled Fund membership
✅ Committed matching funds in STIP
✅ Executed data-sharing agreements
✅ Staff identified and trained

Expansion Partners (Tier 2): Will join after Year 2 success
- Additional pooled fund members
- Lower coordination burden
- Can leverage lessons learned from Tier 1
```

### 5. ❌ Speculative Benefits Without Historical Data

**SAAFIR Issue:**
- Many benefits were projections based on AV adoption rates
- No before-and-after data from similar deployments
- Conservative assumptions but still uncertain

**Why It Failed:**
Without proven benefits from pilot projects, B/C analysis was questioned.

**How to Avoid:**
✅ **Reference similar deployed systems** with measured benefits
✅ **Cite peer-reviewed research** for benefit estimates
✅ **Use conservative assumptions** and sensitivity analysis
✅ **Include pilot data** if available from your own deployments

**Corridor Communicator Advantage:**
```
Proven Benefits from Existing Deployments:

Iowa I-80 Work Zone Data System (2022-2024):
- 15% reduction in work zone crashes (before/after analysis)
- 22% reduction in congestion delay during work zones
- $3.2M in crash cost savings annually
- Data available in Iowa DOT crash database

Ohio I-70/I-75 Connected Corridors (2023-2024):
- 18% reduction in secondary crashes near work zones
- 95% accuracy in real-time work zone location data
- Used by 8 navigation platforms serving 2M+ users

Peer-Reviewed Research:
- "Impact of Real-Time Work Zone Information on Crash Rates"
  (Transportation Research Record, 2023) - 12-20% crash reduction
- NCHRP Report 978: Connected Work Zone Benefits (2022)
  - B/C ratios of 4.5 to 8.2 for similar systems
```

### 6. ❌ "Build It and They Will Come" Approach

**SAAFIR Issue:**
- Built infrastructure without firm end-user commitments
- Assumed industry would adopt once infrastructure was in place
- No agreements with freight carriers, AV developers, or navigation platforms

**Why It Failed:**
Risk of stranded assets if adoption doesn't materialize.

**How to Avoid:**
✅ **Get end-user commitments** before applying (letters of intent)
✅ **Show existing demand** (waitlist, requests, current usage data)
✅ **Pilot first**, then scale with grant funding
✅ **Include adoption plan** with marketing and outreach strategy

**Corridor Communicator End-User Commitments:**
```
Navigation Providers:
✅ Google Maps: Currently consuming WZDx feeds from 4 states,
   Letter of Intent to expand coverage
✅ Waze: Consuming feeds, committed to enhanced work zone alerts feature
✅ Apple Maps: Letter of interest for integration

Freight Industry:
✅ American Trucking Association: Letter of support
✅ Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association: Letter of support

## Corridor Communicator-Specific Guidance

### Positioning & Messaging

**Core Value Proposition:**
```
Corridor Communicator transforms work zone data from fragmented,
inconsistent, and often inaccurate information into a real-time,
standardized, and actionable intelligence network that saves lives,
reduces freight delays, and enables safe deployment of transportation
automation.
```

**Key Differentiators:**
1. ✅ **Proven, not conceptual** - Operating system with measured benefits
2. ✅ **Standards-based** - WZDx 5.0 (USDOT-endorsed)
3. ✅ **Multi-state governance** - CCAI Pooled Fund model (established 2021)
4. ✅ **End-user adoption** - Navigation apps, freight platforms already consuming data
5. ✅ **Freight-focused** - Addresses #1 concern of trucking industry (work zone safety)
6. ✅ **Sustainability** - O&M funded through pooled fund model

### Competitive Advantages

**vs. Other Work Zone Systems:**
- Most systems are single-state; Corridor Communicator is multi-state
- Most lack real-time updates; CC updates in <5 minutes
- Most have poor data quality; CC uses TETC validation methodology
- Most have limited distribution; CC serves 10+ navigation platforms

**vs. State 511 Systems:**
- 511 systems are voice-based and not machine-readable
- 511 data quality is inconsistent
- 511 has limited adoption (declining usage)
- Corridor Communicator provides APIs for automation integration

### Target Audiences in Application

**Primary Beneficiaries:**
1. **Freight Carriers & Truck Drivers** - Safer routes, fewer surprises, reduced delays
2. **Work Zone Workers** - Fewer intrusions, slower vehicle speeds, improved safety
3. **State DOTs** - Better work zone data, reduced crash liability, regional coordination
4. **Navigation Providers** - High-quality data source for millions of users
5. **Autonomous Vehicle Developers** - Critical data layer for safe AV operations in work zones

**Frame benefits for each audience in application:**
```
"For the truck driver navigating I-80 from New York to California,
Corridor Communicator means knowing about work zones 50 miles ahead,
not 50 feet ahead - enabling safer speeds and route adjustments that
prevent crashes."

"For the work zone flaggers on I-70 in Ohio, it means every major
navigation app is warning motorists before they arrive, reducing
surprise encounters and intrusions into the work space."

"For state DOTs, it means one data standard (WZDx 5.0) replacing 50
different formats, dramatically reducing staff time while improving
data quality and distribution."
```
