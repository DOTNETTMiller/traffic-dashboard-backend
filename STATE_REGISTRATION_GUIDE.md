# State Traffic API Registration Guide

## Welcome!

The DOT Corridor Communicator is a multi-state traffic event monitoring and communication platform. We welcome additional state DOT agencies to integrate their traffic data feeds.

## Registration Process

To add your state to the platform, please provide the following information to the system administrator:

### Required Information

1. **State Name**: Full name of your state (e.g., "Wyoming", "New Mexico")
2. **State Key**: Short identifier (lowercase, no spaces, e.g., "wyoming", "newmexico")
3. **API Endpoint URL**: The full URL to your traffic events API
4. **API Type**: The format of your API (see supported formats below)
5. **Data Format**: Response format (json, xml, rss, etc.)

### Optional: API Credentials

If your API requires authentication, please securely provide:
- **API Key**: If using API key authentication
- **Username/Password**: If using Basic Authentication
- **Other**: Custom authentication headers or tokens

Note: All credentials are encrypted using AES-256-CBC encryption before storage.

## Supported API Formats

### 1. WZDx (Work Zone Data Exchange)
**Recommended**: Industry standard format for work zone data.
- Format: JSON
- Standard: [WZDx Specification](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/wzdx)
- Example: `https://your-state-dot.gov/api/wzdx/v4/feed`

### 2. FEU-G (Field Equipment Update - General)
- Format: Custom JSON
- Common fields: event type, location, severity, timestamps
- Example: `https://your-state-dot.gov/api/feu-g/events`

### 3. RSS Feed
- Format: RSS/XML
- Must include: title, description, lat/long coordinates
- Example: `https://your-state-dot.gov/api/traffic/rss`

### 4. Custom JSON
- Format: Custom JSON structure
- We can work with your existing format
- Please provide sample response

## Sample Data Requirements

Your API response should include:

## Testing Your API

Before registration, please verify:
1. ‚úÖ API endpoint is publicly accessible (or credentials provided)
2. ‚úÖ CORS headers allow cross-origin requests
3. ‚úÖ Response includes location data (coordinates or description)
4. ‚úÖ Data is updated regularly
5. ‚úÖ API is stable and production-ready

## Registration Submission

### Method 1: Contact Administrator
Email your API details to the system administrator who will add your state using the admin panel.

### Method 2: Self-Service Registration (If Enabled)
If you have been provided an admin token:

1. Navigate to the Corridor Communicator admin panel
2. Click "Admin" in the navigation
3. Enter your admin token
4. Click "Add New State"
5. Fill in the form with your state's information
6. Click "Add State"
7. Use "Test Connection" to verify the integration

## After Registration

Once your state is added:
1. **Test the Integration**: View your events on the map and table views
2. **Verify Data Quality**: Check that all fields are mapping correctly
3. **Monitor Performance**: Ensure your API can handle regular polling
4. **Update as Needed**: Contact admin if API endpoints or credentials change

## API Requirements

### Performance
- Response time: < 5 seconds
- Availability: > 99% uptime recommended
- Rate limiting: Should support at least 1 request per minute

### Data Refresh
- Update frequency: Minimum every 15 minutes
- Real-time updates preferred for active incidents

### CORS Configuration
If hosting your own API, ensure CORS headers are set:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
```
