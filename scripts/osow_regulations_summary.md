## Recommendations for Permit Planning

### 1. Multi-State Movements
- Research ALL states on route
- Apply for permits well in advance (10-30 days recommended)
- Consider reciprocal agreements (Northeast multi-state permits)
- Plan for most restrictive state's requirements

### 2. Cost Optimization
- Annual permits cost-effective for >5-10 trips per year (varies by state)
- Compare single trip vs multiple trip vs annual costs
- Factor in escort, insurance, and compliance costs

### 3. Route Planning
- Avoid states with severe restrictions if possible
- Plan around holiday and weekend restrictions
- Consider toll road alternatives (may have different limits)
- Allow extra time for metro area time restrictions

### 4. Timing Strategies
- Avoid peak summer travel (July-August) in tourist areas
- Plan around spring thaw restrictions (Feb-May in northern states)
- Consider night movement where permitted (DE, MS, WI, WA)
- Allow buffer time for weather delays (NM wind restrictions, winter weather)

### 5. Superload Planning
- Allow 30-90 days advance notice
- Budget for engineering reviews ($100-$500+)
- Expect extensive route surveys and utility coordination
- Consider state police/law enforcement escorts
- Plan for potential road closures or traffic control

---

## Data Confidence Levels

### High Confidence (Official Sources)
All 36 states have data derived from:
- Official state DOT websites and permit manuals
- Published regulations and statutes
- Industry-standard permit services (oversize.io, heavyhaul.net)

### Areas Requiring Verification
- Exact current fee amounts (some states last updated fees in prior years)
- Specific engineering review costs (often case-by-case)
- Superload fees and requirements (highly variable)
- Seasonal restriction dates (change annually)

### Recommended Updates
- Verify fees directly with state permit offices before budgeting
- Confirm seasonal restrictions and holiday schedules annually
- Check for recent regulation changes (especially in 2024)
- Review route-specific requirements with DOT for each movement

---

## Conclusion

This comprehensive dataset provides a solid foundation for OS/OW permit planning across all 36 states with Interstate highways. While some minor limitations exist (primarily around specific fee schedules and case-by-case superload requirements), the data is sufficient for:

1. **Initial Planning:** Understanding state requirements and restrictions
2. **Cost Estimation:** Budgeting for permits (with verification recommended)
3. **Route Selection:** Choosing optimal paths based on restrictions
4. **Compliance:** Ensuring all safety and regulatory requirements are met
5. **Timeline Planning:** Allowing adequate lead time for permits and travel

For specific movements, especially superloads, always contact state DOT permit offices directly for current, official information and route approval.
